## ‚úÖ Steps to Add a New Blog Post

### 1. **Create a Markdown File**

- Create a new file with a `.md` extension.
- The **file name must exactly match the `slug`** specified in the frontmatter metadata inside the file.

üìÅ **Location:**  
Place the file in the following folder at the root of the project:
`/blog-post-files/`



üß© **Example:**  
For a blog post with the slug `my-awesome-article`, the file path should be:
/blog-post-files/my-awesome-article.md

### 2. **Add a Featured Image (Optional but Recommended)**

- If your blog post includes a main/featured image:
  - Save the image in the following directory:
    ``` /public/images/blog/blog-md/ ```
  - Reference this image in the `img` field in the frontmatter.

üñºÔ∏è **Example image path:**
``` /images/blog/blog-md/my-awesome-article.jpg ```
